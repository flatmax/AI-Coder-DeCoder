"""Edit protocol parser — stateless block extraction.

Parses the LLM's streaming response text for edit blocks and
returns structured results. Does NOT touch the filesystem or the
repo — validation (anchor matching) and application live in
:mod:`edit_pipeline`.

Governing specs:

- ``specs4/3-llm/edit-protocol.md`` — block structure, marker
  byte sequences, state machine, file-path detection, streaming
  considerations
- ``specs-reference/3-llm/edit-protocol.md`` — concrete regex
  rules for file path detection (Python-side, more permissive
  than the frontend parser)

## Block Shape

Each edit block comprises four literal marker-bearing lines
bracketing two content sections:

1. A line containing the file path (relative to repo root)
2. Start marker: ``🟧🟧🟧 EDIT``
3. Old text — exact copy from the file (the anchor)
4. Separator marker: ``🟨🟨🟨 REPL``
5. New text — the replacement content
6. End marker: ``🟩🟩🟩 END``

The orange → yellow → green colour progression makes malformed
blocks (missing separator, missing end) visible at review time.
The parser matches on the literal byte sequences; it does NOT
do fuzzy matching.

## Streaming Discipline

The parser is a stateful finite-state machine designed to
accumulate across chunks. Call :meth:`EditParser.feed` with each
streaming chunk; completed blocks emerge from :meth:`finalize`
after the stream ends. A block that's partially received when
the stream ends becomes an ``incomplete`` result rather than
silently failing — the streaming handler surfaces these as
"pending" edit cards in the UI.

## Design Decisions Pinned Here

- **Marker bytes are exact.** The Python parser never accepts
  ASCII substitutions like ``<<< EDIT`` or ``=== REPL``. The
  system prompt explicitly instructs the LLM to emit the emoji
  sequences; a malformed block is an LLM error, not a parser
  tolerance concern.
- **File path detection is Python-side authoritative.** The
  frontend has its own simpler heuristic (see
  specs-reference/3-llm/edit-protocol.md § Frontend vs backend
  detection divergence); the backend's is permissive enough to recognise
  ``Makefile``, ``Dockerfile``, ``.gitignore`` etc. without
  requiring extensions.
- **No anchor validation here.** This module returns parsed
  blocks with ``old_text`` and ``new_text`` strings; the
  pipeline module matches anchors against file content.
  Separating parse from apply keeps streaming chunk handling
  simple and lets tests exercise each concern in isolation.
- **Create blocks have empty old text.** A block whose EDIT
  section is empty is a file-creation directive. Parsing
  doesn't distinguish — the ``is_create`` flag is derived from
  ``not old_text`` at the edge between parser and pipeline.

    — the parser surfaces them so a future agent-spawning path
    can pick them up without a parser rewrite.

    Two required fields:

    - ``id`` — identifier the main LLM uses to reference this
      agent in subsequent review / synthesis. Scoped to the
      turn; unique within the turn's decomposition. Convention
      is ``agent-N`` (zero-indexed) but the parser accepts any

      span multiple lines (continuation lines without a
      ``key:`` prefix are appended to the current field's
      value with a newline separator).

    ``extras`` carries forward-compatible unknown fields. Per
    ``specs4/7-future/mcp-integration.md``, a future MCP
    integration uses this slot for the optional ``tools:``
    field without requiring a parser change. The current
    implementation doesn't interpret these — it just captures
    them.

    ``valid`` flags whether the block had both required fields
    on emission. Missing required fields don't silently drop
    the block — callers can surface the malformed output to
    the user / LLM as feedback.
