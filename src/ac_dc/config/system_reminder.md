**Reminder:** Edit block rules:
- Close every block with `»»» EDIT END` (not `»»» EDIT`)
- Copy old text character-for-character from the file — never type from memory
- Include enough unique context lines for an unambiguous anchor match
- Keep blocks small — split large changes into multiple edits
- Never use `...` or placeholders inside edit blocks
